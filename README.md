# The Silk Language
Silk is a lightweight cross-platform programming language which supports procedural programming and object-oriented programming. 

- It's simple, you can learn the entire syntax in 30 minutes.
- It's small, the compiled binary is only 600K without any dependencies.
- It's powerful, it can be integrated into any Text/HTML as server-side language. It's easy to extend Silk with libraries written in other languages.

Silk example:
```
/* 
The function to caculate fibonacci sequence 
parameter: n
return: fibonacci sequence 
*/
func Fibonacci(n)
{
    if (n == 0)
        return 0;
    else if (n <= 2)
        return 1;
    else
        return Fibonacci(n-1)+Fibonacci(n-2);//Recursion
}

main()
{
    //print the top 20 fibonacci sequence
    for(i=0;i<20;i++)
        print(Fibonacci(i));
}
```
